Due to the unlimited nature of unique builds and custom setups, it is impossible for us to guarantee that this software will work with every users installation, as is the nature of all plugins. However, MapifyPro is thoroughly tested to the highest standards, and is designed to be compatible with as many setups as possible. 

Support will be offered to professional, polite inquiries. Rude inquiries will potentially be ignored as we insist on a positive work environment for our tech support agents and all staff. Please allow up to 48 hours for a response.

This software uses a subscription model that allows you to update to the latest security fixes, free features, and other updates. Subscription length is for 1 year.
